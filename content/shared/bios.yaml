abel:
  born: 1802

  name: Abel
  overflow: true
  bio: |
    __Niels Henrik Abel__ (1802 – 1829) was an important Norwegian
    mathematician. Even though he died at the age of 26, he made groundbreaking
    contributions to a wide range of topics.

    At the age of 16, Abel proved the binomial theorem. Three years later, he
    proved that it is impossible to solve quintic equations – by independently
    inventing group theory. This had been an open problem for over 350 years! He
    also worked on elliptic functions and discovered _Abelian_ functions.

    Abel spent his life in poverty: he had six siblings, his father died when he
    was 18, he was unable to find a job at a university, and many mathematicians
    initially dismissed his work. Today, one of the highest awards in
    mathematics, the _Abel Prize_ is named after him.

  name: Al-Haytham
  bio: |
    __Hasan Ibn al-Haytham__ (أبو علي، الحسن بن الحسن بن الهيثم, c. 965 – 1050)
    lived in Cairo during the Islamic Golden Age, and studied mathematics,
    physics, astronomy, philosophy and medicine. He was a proponent of the
    _scientific method_: the belief that any a scientific hypothesis must be
    verified using experiments or mathematical logic – centuries before
    European scientists during the Renaissance.

    Al-Haytham was particularly interested in optics and visual perception. He
    also derived a formula for the sum of fourth powers (`1^4 + 2^4 + 3^4 + … +
    n^4`), and he studied the link between algebra and geometry.

  bio: |
    The Persian mathematician __Muhammad Al-Khwarizmi__ (محمد بن موسى الخوارزمي‎,
    780 – 850) lived during the golden age of the Muslim Abbasid regime in
    Baghdad. He worked at the “House of Wisdom”, which contained the first large
    collection of academic books since the destruction of the Library of
    Alexandria.

    Al-Khwarizmi has been called the “father of algebra” – in fact, the word
    _algebra_ comes from the Arabic title of his most important book: “The
    Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing”. In it, he
    showed how to solve linear and quadratic equations, and for many centuries,
    it was the main mathematics textbook at European universities.

    Al-Khwarizmi also worked in astronomy and geography, and the word
    “algorithm” is named after him.

  born: -287
  died: -212
  bio: |
    __Archimedes__ (c. 287 – c. 212 BC) was an ancient Greek scientist and
    engineer, and one of the greatest mathematicians of all time. He discovered
    many concepts of calculus, and worked in geometry, analysis and mechanics.

    While taking a bath, Archimedes discovered a way to determine the volume of
    irregular objects using the amount of water they displaced when submerged.
    He was so excited by this discovery that he ran out on the street, still
    undressed, yelling _“Eureka!”_ (Greek for _“I have found it!”_).

    As engineer he built ingenious defence machines during the siege of his home
    city Syracuse in Sicily. After two years, the Romans finally managed to
    enter and Archimedes was killed. His last words were _“Do not disturb my
    circles”_ – which he was studying at the time.

    __Aristotle__ (Ἀριστοτέλης, c. 384 – 322 BC) was a philosopher in Ancient
    Greece. Together with his teacher _Plato_, he is considered the “Father of
    Western Philosophy”. He was also the private tutor of Alexander the Great.

    Aristotle wrote about science, mathematics, philosophy, poetry, music,
    politics, rhetoric, linguistics, and many other subjects. His work was
    highly influential during the Middle Ages and into the Renaissance, and his
    views on ethics and other philosophical questions are still being discussed
    today.

    Aristotle is also the first known person to formally study _logic_,
    including its applications in science and mathematics.

    __Charles Babbage__ (1791 – 1871) was a British mathematician, philosopher
    and engineer. He is often called the “father of the computer”, having
    invented the first mechanical computer (the _Difference engine_), and an
    improved, programmable version (the _Analytical Engine_).

    In theory, these machines could automatically perform certain calculations
    stored on cards or tape. However, due to the high production costs, they
    were never fully completed during Babbage’s lifetime. In 1991, a functional
    replica was constructed at the Science Museum in London.

bernoulli-1:
  born: 1654
  died: 1705
  name: Bernoulli
  bio: |
    __Jacob Bernoulli__ (1655 – 1705) was a Swiss mathematician, and one of the
    many important scientists in the Bernoulli family. In fact, he had a deep
    academic rivalry with several of his brothers and sons.

    Jacob made significant advances to the calculus that was invented by Newton
    and Leibnitz, created the field of _calculus of variations_, discovered the
    fundamental constant _e_, developed techniques for solving differential
    equations, and much more.

    He published the first substantial work about probability, including
    permutations, combinations and the law of large numbers, he proved the
    binomial theorem, and derived many of the properties of Bernoulli numbers.

bernoulli-2:
  born: 1700
  died: 1782
  name: Bernoulli
  bio: |
    __Daniel Bernoulli__ (1700 – 1782) was a Swiss mathematician and physicist.
    He was one of the many famous scientists from the Bernoulli family –
    including his father Johann, his uncle Jacob, and his brother Nicholas.

    Daniel Bernoulli showed that as the speed of a fluid increases, its pressure
    decreases. Now called _Bernoulli’s principle_, this is the mechanism used by
    airplane wings and combustion engines. He also made important discoveries
    in probability and statistics, and first encountered _Bessel functions_.

    At the age of 34, he was banned from his father’s house for beating him at
    an award from the Paris Academy, for which they both submitted an entry.

bhaskara:
  born: 1114
  died: 1185
  name: Bhaskara
  bio: __Bhaskara II__ (1114 – 1185) was an Indian mathematician and astronomer.
    He discovered some of the basic concepts of calculus, more than 500 years
    before Leibnitz and Newton. Bhaskara also established that division by zero
    yields infinity, and solved various quadratic, cubic, quartic and
    Diophantine equations.

blackwell:

  bio: |
    __David Blackwell__ (1919 – 2010) was an American statistician and
    mathematician. He worked on game theory, probability theory, information
    theory and dynamic programming, and wrote one of the first textbooks on
    Bayesian statistics. The _Rao-Blackwell Theorem_ shows how to improve
    estimators of certain quantities in statistics.

    Blackwell was the first African-American elected to join the American
    _National Academy of Sciences_, and he was one of the first to receive a
    PhD in mathematics.

  bio: |
    __János Bolyai__ (1802 – 1860) was a Hungarian mathematician, and one of
    the founders of non-Euclidean geometry – a geometry in which Euclid’s fifth
    axiom about parallel lines does not hold. This was a significant
    breakthrough in mathematics. Unfortunately for Bolyai, the mathematicians
    Gauss and Lobachevsky discovered similar results at the same time, and
    received most of the credit.

  name: Boole
  bio: __George Boole__ (1815 – 1864) was an English mathematician. As a child,
    he taught himself Latin, Greek and mathematics, hoping to escape his lower
    class life. He created _Boolean algebra_, which uses operators like AND, OR
    and NOT (rather than addition or multiplication) and can be used when
    working with sets. This was the foundation for formal mathematical logic,
    and has many applications in computer science.

brahmagupta:
  born: 598

  name: Brahmagupta
  overflow: true
  bio: The Indian mathematician __Brahmagupta__ (c. 598 – 668 AD) invented the
    rules for addition, subtraction and multiplication with zero and negative
    numbers. He was also an astronomer and made many other discoveries in
    mathematics. Unfortunately, his writings did not contain any proofs, so we
    don’t know how he derived his results.

cantor:
  born: 1845
  died: 1918
  name: Cantor
  bio: |
    The German mathematician __Georg Cantor__ (1845 – 1918) was the inventor of
    set theory, and a pioneer in our understanding of infinity. For most of his
    life, Cantor's discoveries were fiercely opposed by his colleagues. This may
    have contributed to his depression and nervous breakdowns, and he spent many
    decades in a mental institution.

    Cantor proved that there are _different sizes_ of infinity. The set of real
    numbers, for example, is _uncountable_ – meaning that it cannot be paired up
    with the set of real numbers.

    Only towards the end of his life, Cantor started to receive the recognition
    he deserved. David Hilbert famously declared that “No one shall expel us
    from the paradise that Cantor has created”.

    The Italian __Gerolamo Cardano__ (1501 – 1576) was one of the most
    influential mathematicians and scientists of the Renaissance. He
    investigated hypercycloids, published Tartaglia’s and Ferrari’s solution for
    cubic and quartic equations, was the first European to systematically use
    negative numbers, and even acknowledged the existing of imaginary numbers
    (based on `sqrt(-1)`).

    Cardano also made some early progress in probability theory and introduced
    binomial coefficients and binomial theorem to Europe. He invented many
    mechanical devices, including combination locks, gyroscopes with three
    degrees of freedom, and drive shafts (or Cardan shafts) that are still used
    in vehicles today.

    __Lewis Carroll__, as the author of _Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland_ and
    its sequel _Through the Looking-Glass_.

    However, Carroll was also a brilliant mathematician. He always tried to
    incorporate puzzles and logic into his children’s stories, making them more
    enjoyable and memorable.

cauchy:

  bio: |
    __Nicolaus Copernicus__ (1473 – 1543) was a Polish mathematician,
    astronomer and lawyer. During his life, most people believed in the
    _Geocentric_ model of the universe, with Earth at the centre and
    everything else rotating around it.

    Copernicus created a new model, where the sun is at the centre, and Earth
    moves around it on a circle. He also predicted that Earth rotates around its
    axis once every day. Afraid that it would upset the Catholic church, he
    only published the model just before his death – triggering what is now
    called the _Copernican Revolution_.

    Copernicus also worked as a diplomat and physician, and made important
    contributions to economist.

    __Abraham de Moivre__ (1667 – 1754) was a French mathematician who worked
    in probability and analytic geometry. He is most remembered for _de Moivre's
    formula_, which linkes trigonometry and complex numbers.

    De Moivre discovered the formula for the normal distribution in probability,

    the students of Gauss. He developed many concepts in set theory, and
    invented _Dedekind cuts_ as the formal definition of real numbers. He also
    gave the first definitions of _number fields_ and _rings_, two important
    constructs in abstract algebra.

  bio: |
    __Girard Desargues__ (1591 – 1661) was a French mathematician, engineer,
    and architect. He designed numerous buildings in Paris and Lyon, helped
    construct a dam, and invented a mechanism for raising water using
    epicycloids.

    In mathematics, Desargues is considered the father of _projective geometry_.
    This is a special kind of geometry in which parallel lines meet at at “point
    at infinity”, the size of shapes does not matter (only their proportions),
    and all four conic sections (circle, ellipse, parabola and hyperbola) are
    essentially the same.

  bio: |
    __René Descartes__ (1596 – 1650) was a French mathematician and philosopher,
    and one of the key figures in the Scientific Revolution. He refused to
    accept the authority of previous philosophers, and one of his best-known
    quotes is “I think, therefore I am”.

    Descartes is the father of _analytical geometry_, which allows us to
    describe geometric shapes using algebra. This was one of the prerequisites,
    which allowed Newton and Leibnitz to invent _calculus_ a few decades later.

    He is credited with the first use of superscripts for powers or exponents,
    and the _cartesian coordinate system_ is named after him.

diophantus:

  bio: |
    __Diophantus__ was a Hellenistic mathematician who lived in Alexandria.
    Most of his works are about solving polynomial equations with several
    unknowns. These are now called _Diophantine equation_ and remain an
    important area of research today.

    It was while reading one of Diophantus’ books, many centuries later, that
    _Pierre de Fermat_ proposed one of these equations had no solution. This
    became known as “Fermat’s Last Theorem”, and was only solved in 1994.

dirac:

    __Paul Dirac__ (1898 – 1972) was an English theoretical physicist, who
    shared the 1933 Nobel Prize with Erwin Schrödinger. Dirac was one of the
    pioneers of Quantum Mechanics, formulated the famous _Dirac equation_ and
    first predicted the existence of antimatter.

    He taught at Cambridge University, before moving to America. Dirac was
    famously shy and, according to Einstein, _“balancing on the dizzying path
    between genius and madness”_.

    most influential scientists in history. He received the Nobel Prize for
    physics and TIME magazine called him the _person of the 20th century_.

    Einstein triggered the most significant transformation in our view of the
    universe since Newton. He realised that classical, _Newtonian_ physics was
    no longer enough to explain certain physical phenomenons.

    At the age of 26, during his “miracle year”, he published four
    groundbreaking scientific papers that explained the photoelectric effect
    and Brownian motion, introduced special relativity, and derived the formula
    `E = m c^2`, which states that energy (_E_) and mass (_m_) are equivalent.

    mathematician, geographer, astronomer, historian, and poet. He spent much
    of his life in Egypt, as head of the library of Alexandria.

    Among many other achievements, Eratosthenes calculated the circumference of
    the Earth, measured the tilt of the Earth’s axis of rotation, estimated the
    distance to the sun, and created some of the first maps of the world.

    He also invented the “Sieve of Eratosthenes”, an efficient way to
    calculate _prime numbers_.

    __Leonardo Pisano__, commonly known as __Fibonacci__ (1175 – 1250) was an
    Italian mathematician. He is best known for the number sequence named after
    him: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, …

    Fibonacci is also responsible for popularising the Arabic numerals (0, 1, 2,
    3, 4, …) in Europe, which was still using Roman numerals (I, V, X, D, …) in
    the 12th century AD. He explained the decimal system in a book called “Liber
    Abaci”, a practical textbook for merchants.

    __Joseph Fourier__ (1768 – 1830) was a French mathematician, and a friend
    and advisor of Napoleon. In addition to his mathematical research, he is
    also credited with the discovery of the greenhouse effect.

    While travelling to Egypt, Fourier became particularly fascinated with
    _heat_. He studied heat transfer and vibrations, and discovered that any
    periodic function can be written as an infinite sum of trigonometric
    functions: a _Fourier series_.

  bio: |
    __Galileo Galilei__ (1564 – 1642) was an Italian astronomer, physicist and
    engineer. He used one of the first telescopes to make observations of the
    night sky, where he discovered the four largest moons of Jupiter, the phases
    of Venus, sunspots, and much more.

    Galileo, sometimes called the “father of modern science”, also studied the
    motion of objects in free fall, kinematics, material science, and invented
    the thermoscope (an early thermometer).

    He was a vocal proponent of _Heliocentrism_, the idea that the Sun was at
    the centre of our solar system. This eventually led to him being tried by
    the Catholic Inquisition: Galileo was forced to recant and spent the rest
    of his life under house arrest.

galois:

  bio: |
    The French mathematician __Évariste Galois__ (1811 – 1832) had a short and
    tragic life, yet he invented two entirely new fields of mathematics: _Group
    theory_ and _Galois theory_.

    While still in his teens, Galois proved that there is no general solution
    for polynomial equations of degree five or higher – simultaneously with
    Niels Abel.

    Unfortunately, other mathematicians who he shared these discoveries with
    repeatedly misplaced or simply returned his work, and he failed his school
    and university exams while concentrating on much more complex work.

    At the age of 21, Galois was shot in a duel (some say a feud over a woman),
    and later died of his wounds. In the night before his death, he summarised
    his mathematical discoveries in a letter to a friend. It would take other
    mathematicians many years to fully realise the true impact of his work.

    According to legend, he corrected a mistake in his father‘s accounting at
    the age of 3, and found a way to quickly add up all integers from 1 to 1000
    at the age of 8. He made his first important discoveries while still a

    history.

    At the age of 25, just after finishing his doctorate in Vienna, he published
    his two _incompleteness theorems_. These state that any (consistent and
    sufficiently powerful) mathematical system contains certain statements that
    are true but cannot be proven. In other words, mathematics contains certain
    problems that are impossible to solve.

    This result had a profound impact on the development and philosophy of
    mathematics. Gödel also found an example of these “impossible theorems”:
    the _continuum hypothesis_.

  bio: |
    __Florence Nightingale__ (1820 – 1910) was an English nurse and
    statistician. During the Crimean War, she nursed wounded British soldiers,
    and later founded the first training school for nurses. As the “The Lady
    with the Lamp”, she bacame a cultural icon, and new nurses in the US still
    take the _Nightingale pledge_.

    One of her most important contributions to medicine was the use of
    statistics to evaluate treatments. She created numerous infographics, and
    was one of the first to use pie charts. Nightingale also worked to improve
    sanitation and hunger relief in India, helped abolish prostitution laws, and
    promoted new careers for women.

    In 2003, the Russian mathematician __Grigori Perelman__ (Григо́рий
    Перельма́нborn, born 1966) proved the _Poincaré Conjecture_, which, until
    then, was one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics.

    The complex proof was verified by 2006, but Perelman declined two big awards
    that came with it: the $1 million Clay Millennium Prize, and the _Fields
    Medal_ which is the highest recognition in mathematics. In fact, he said:
    _“I’m not interested in money or fame; I don’t want to be on display like an
    animal in a zoo.”_

    Perelman also made contributions to Riemannian geometry and geometric
    topology, and the Poincaré Conjecture is still the only one of the seven
    Millennium Prize problems to have been solved.

  name: Poincaré
  bio: |
    The French mathematician __Henri Poincaré__ (1854 – 1912) is often
    described as _the last universalist_, meaning that he worked in every field
    of mathematics known during his lifetime.

    Poincaré is one of the founders of the field of _Topology_, and he came up
    with the _Poincaré conjecture_. This was one of the famous unsolved problems
    in mathematics, until it was proven in 2003 by Grigori Perelman

    He also found a partial solution for the “three body problem”, and
    discovered that the motion of three stars or planets in space can be
    completely unpredictable. This laid the foundation for modern _Chaos
    theory_.

    Poincaré was the first to propose _gravitational waves_, and his work on
    Lorentz transformations was the basis upon which Albert Einstein built his
    theory of special relativity.

    __Claudius Ptolemy__ (c. 100 – 170 AD) was a Greco-Roman mathematician,
    astronomer, geographer and astrologer. He is best remembered for the
    _Ptolemaic_ or _Geocentric_ model of our universe – that Earth is in the
    centre and all planets and the sun revolve around this.

    While we know today this model is incorrect, Ptolemy’s scientific impact is
    indisputable. He developed trigonometric tables with many practical
    applications, which remained the most accurate for many centuries. He also
    created detailed maps of the Earth, and wrote about music theory and optics.

    __Pythagoras of Samos__ (c. 570 – 495 BC) was a Greek philosopher and
    mathematician. He is best known for proving _Pythagoras’ Theorem_, but made
    many other mathematical and scientific discoveries.

    Pythagoras tried to explain music in a mathematical way, and discovered that
    two tones sound “nice” together (consonant) if the ratio of their
    frequencies is a simple fraction.

    He also founded a school in Italy where he and his students worshipped
    mathematics almost like a religion, while following a number of bizarre
    rules – but the school was eventually burned down by their adversaries.

  bio: |
    __Srinivasa Ramanujan__ (1887 – 1920) grew up in India, where he received
    very little formal education in mathematics. Yet, he managed to develop new
    ideas in complete isolation, while working as a clerk in a small shop.

    After a few failed attempts to contact other mathematicians, he wrote a
    letter to the famous G.H. Hardy. Hardy immediately recognised Ramanujan's
    genius, and arranged for him to travel to Cambridge in England. Together,
    they made numerous discoveries in number theory, analysis, and infinite
    series.

    Unfortunately, Ramanujan soon fell ill and was forced to return to India,
    where he died at the age of 32. During his short life, Ramanujan proved over
    3000 theorems and equations, on a wide range of topics. His work created
    entirely new areas of maths, and his notebooks were studied by other
    mathematicians for many decades after his death.

  name: Wiles
  bio: |
    The British mathematician Sir __Andrew Wiles__ (born 1953) is best known for
    proving Fermat’s Last Theorem, which, until then, was one of the most famous
    unsolved problems in mathematics.

    In 1637, Pierre de Fermat, wrote in the margin of a textbook that he had a
    wonderful proof that the equation `a^n + b^n = c^n` has no integer
    solutions for `n > 2`. Unfortunately, no one was able to find a proof –
    until Wiles, some 400 years later.

    Wiles had been fascinated by the problem since the age of 10, and spent
    seven years working on it in solitude. He announced his solution in 1993,
    although a small gap in his argument took two more years to fix.

    He was too old to receive the _Fields medal_, the highest award in
    mathematics, which has an age limit of 40. Instead, Wiles was awarded a
    special silver plaque for his work.
