Mathematics has been studied for thousands of years – to predict the seasons,
calculate taxes, or estimate the size of farming land.

Mathematicians in ancient Greece, around 500 BC, were amazed by mathematical
patterns, and wanted to explore and explain them. For the first time, they began
to study mathematics just “for fun”, without a specific application in mind.

One of these mathematicians was [Thales of Miletus](bio:thales), who made a
surprising discovery when playing around with geometric shapes:

::: column.grow
Start by picking two points anywhere in the box on the left.
_{span.reveal(when="p1 p2")} Let’s draw a semicircle around these points._

{.reveal(when="p1 p2")} Now pick a third point that lies somewhere on the
[circumference](target:circumf) of the semicircle.

{.reveal(when="p3")} Let’s draw the [triangle](target:triangle) formed by the
two corners of the semicircle, as well as the point you picked on the
circumference.

{.reveal(when="p3" delay=1000)} Try moving the position of the three points and
observe what happens to the [angle](target:angle) at the top of the triangle.
_{span.reveal(when="move")} It seems like it is always [[90]]°!_
_{span.reveal(when="blank-0")} This means that the triangle is
[[right-angled|equilateral|acute]]._

For Thales, this was a pretty spectacular result. Why should _semicircles_ and
_right-angled triangles_, two completely different shapes, be linked in this
fundamental way? He was so awed by his discovery that, according to legend, he
sacrificed an entire ox to thank the gods.

However, simply _observing_ a relationship like this was not enough for Thales.
He wanted to understand _why_ it is true, and verify that it is _always_ true
– not just in the few examples he tried.

An argument that logically explains, beyond any doubt, why something must be
true, is called a [__proof__](gloss:proof). In the following courses you will
learn a number of geometric techniques, that will eventually allow us to prove
_Thales’ theorem_.

But geometry is not just useful for proving theorems – it is everywhere around
us, in nature, architecture, technology and design. We need geometry for
everything from measuring distances to constructing skyscrapers or sending
satellites into space. Here are a few more examples:

In this and the following courses, you will learn about many different tools and
techniques in geometry, that were discovered by mathematicians over the course
of many centuries. We will also see how these techniques can be used to solve
important problems in the real world.

## Geometric Definitions

Before we can write any proofs, we need some common terminology that will make
it easier to talk about geometric objects. These are not particularly exciting,
but you should already know most of them:

::: column(width=240)

    x-geopad(width=240 height=160): svg
      circle.move.pulsate(cx=100 cy=30 target="move" label="P")
      circle.move.pulsate(cx=150 cy=100 target="move" label="Q")
      circle.move.pulsate(cx=40 cy=75 target="move")
      circle(x="point(200,50)" target="no-move")
      circle(x="point(70,120)" target="no-move" label="R")

::: column.grow
A [__point__](gloss:point) is a specific location in space. Points describe a
position, but have no _size_ or _shape_ themselves. They are labelled using
capital letters.

{.r} In Mathigon, [large, solid dots](target:move) indicate interactive points
you can move around, while [smaller, outlined dots](target:no-move) indicate
fixed points which you can’t move.

      circle.move(name="Q" cx=200 cy=130 label="Q")
      path.yellow(x="line(P,Q)")

::: column.grow
A [__line__](gloss:line) is a set of infinitely many points that extend forever
in both directions. Lines are always straight and, just like points, they don’t
take up any space – they have no _width_.

{.r} Lines are labeled using lower-case letters. We can also refer to them using
two points that lie on the line, for example
<span class="math"><mover><mi>PQ</mi><mo value="↔">↔</mo></mover></span> or
<span class="math"><mover><mi>QP</mi><mo value="↔">↔</mo></mover></span>. The
order of the points does not matter.

      path.blue(x="segment(c,d)")

::: column.grow
{.r} A [__line segment__](gloss:line-segment) is the part of a line between two
points, without extending to infinity. We can label them just like lines, but
without arrows on the bar above: `bar(AB)` or `bar(BA)`. Like, before the order
of the points does not matter.

      circle.move(name="b" cx=190 cy=130 label="B")
      path.yellow(x="ray(a,b)")

::: column.grow
A [__ray__](gloss:ray) is something in between a _line_ and a _line segment_:
it only extends to infinity on one side. You can think of it like _sunrays_:
they start at a point (the sun) and then keep going forever.

{.r} When labelling rays, the arrow shows the direction where it extends to
infinity, for example `vec(AB)`. This time, the order of the points _does_ matter.

::: column.grow
The two shapes on the right basically look identical. They have the same size
and shape, and we could [turn and slide](target:move) one of them to exactly
match up with the other. In geometry, we say that the two shapes are
[__congruent__](gloss:congruent).

The symbol for congruence is `≅`, so we would say that `A ≅ B`.

Two line segments are congruent if they [[have the same length|intersect]]. Two
angles are congruent if they [[have the same size|meet at a point]] (in degrees).

Note the that _“congruent”_ does not mean _“equal”_. For example, congruent
lines and angles don’t have to point in the same direction. Still, _congruence_
has many of the same properties of _equality_:

* Congruence is __symmetric__: if `X ≅ Y` then also `Y ≅ X`.
* Congruence is __reflexive__: any shape is congruent to itself. For example, `A ≅ A`.
* Congruence is __transitive__: if `X ≅ Y` and `Y ≅ Z` then also `X ≅ Z`.

_railroad tracks_. But note that more than two lines can be parallel to each
other!

{.reveal(when="blank-0")} In diagrams, we denote parallel lines by adding one or
more small arrows. In this example, __{.m-red}`a ∥ b ∥ c`__ and
__{.m-yellow}`d ∥ e`__. The `∥` symbol simply means _“is parallel to”_.

## Euclid’s Axioms

::: column.grow
Greek mathematicians realised that to write formal proofs, you need some sort of
_starting point_: simple, intuitive statements, that everyone agrees are true.
These are called [__axioms__](gloss:axiom) (or _postulates_).

A key part of mathematics is combining different axioms to prove more complex
results, using the rules of logic.

The Greek mathematician [Euclid of Alexandria](bio:euclid), who is often called
the _father of geometry_, published the five axioms of geometry:

[line segment](target:1_line).

Each of these axioms looks pretty obvious and self-evident, but together they
form the foundation of geometry, and can be used to deduce almost everything
else. According to none less than [Isaac Newton](bio:newton), _“it’s the glory
of geometry that from so few principles it can accomplish so much”_.

Euclid published the five axioms in a book _“Elements”_. It is the first example
in history of a systematic approach to mathematics, and was used as mathematics
textbook for thousands of years.

::: column(width=220)

    x-media(src="images/elements.jpg" width=220 height=330 lightbox)

One of the people who studied Euclid’s work was the American President [Thomas
Jefferson](bio:jefferson). When writing the Declaration of Independence in 1776,
he wanted to follow a similar approach. He begins by stating a few, simple
“axioms” and then “proves” more complex results:

    .parchment “We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.”

{.text-center.follows} `=>`

    .parchment We, therefore … declare, that these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent states.”

This is just one example where Euclid’s ideas in mathematics have inspired
completely different subjects.

## Geometric Construction

You might have noticed that Euclid’s five axioms don’t contain anything about
_measuring_ distances or angles. Up to now, this has been a key part of
geometry, for example to calculate areas and volumes.

::: column.grow
However, at the times of Thales or Euclid, there wasn’t a universal framework of
units like we have today. Distances were often measured using body parts, for
example finger widths, or arm lengths. These are not very accurate and they vary
for different people.

To measure longer distances, architects or surveyors used _knotted cords_: long
pieces of string that contained many knots at equal intervals. But these were
also not perfectly accurate, and different string had the knots placed at
slightly different distances.

Greek mathematicians didn’t want to deal with these approximations. They were
much more interested in the underlying laws of geometry, than in their practical
applications.

That’s why they came up with a much more idealised version of our universe: one
in which points can have no size and lines can have no width. Of course, it is
[[impossible|very difficult]] to draw these on paper. Visible points will always
take up some space, and lines will always have some width. This is why our
drawings are always just “approximations”.

Euclid’ axioms basically tell us _what’s possible_ in his version of geometry.
It turns out that we just need two very simple tools to be able to sketch this
on paper:

Axioms 4 and 5 are about comparing properties of shapes, rather than drawing
anything. Therefore they don’t need specific tools.

::: column.grow
You can imagine that Greek mathematicians were thinking about Geometry on the
beach, and drawing different shapes in the sand: using long planks as
straight-edge and pieces of string as compass.

Even though these tools look very primitive, you can draw a great number of
shapes with them. This became almost like a puzzle game for mathematicians:
trying to find ways to “construct” different geometric shapes using just a
straight-edge and compass.

### Impossible Constructions

In the following courses, we will see even more shapes that can be constructed
like this. However, there is a limit to Euclidean geometry: some constructions
are simply impossible using just straight-edge and compass.

::: column.grow
According to legend, the city of Delos in ancient Greece was once faced with a
terrible plague. The oracle in Delphi told them that this was a punishment from
the gods, and the plague would go away if they built a new altar for their
temple that was _exactly twice_ the volume of the existing one.

    figure: img(src="images/altar.svg" width=320 height=140)

::: column(width=300)

    x-media(src="images/delphi.jpg" credit="© De Agostini Editorial" width=300 height=239)
    
{.caption} A reconstruction of a temple in Delphi
:::

Note that _doubling the volume_ is not the same as _doubling an edge of the
cube_. In fact, if the [[3-dimensional|2-dimensional|1-dimensional]] volume
increases by a factor of 2, the [[1-dimensional|3-dimensional|2-dimensional]]
edge of the cube will increase by a factor of `root(3)(2)`.

---
> id: impossible-1

This still sounds pretty simple, but doubling the cube is actually impossible
in [Euclidean geometry](gloss:euclidean-geometry), using only straight-edge and
compass! For the citizens of Delos this unfortunately meant that all hope was
lost. There are two other constructions that are famously impossible.
Mathematicians devoted a great amount of time trying to find a solution – but
without success:

    figure: img(src="images/impossible-1.svg" width=200 height=180)

{.text-center} __{.m-red} Trisecting the angle__  
We already know how to bisect angles. However it is impossible to similarly
split an angle into _three_ equal parts.

::: column(width=220)

    figure: img(src="images/impossible-2.svg" width=200 height=180)

{.text-center} __{.m-blue} Doubling the cube__

that has exactly twice the volume.

{.text-center} __{.m-green} Squaring the circle__  
Given a circle, it is impossible to construct a square that has exactly the same
area.
:::

Note that these problems can all be solved quite easily with algebra, or using
marked rulers and protractors. But they are impossible if you are just allowed to
use straight-edge and compass.

## Origami and Paper Folding

Using straight-edge and compass is not the only way to construct geometric
shapes. Another technique uses no tools at all: __Origami__.

The word _Origami_ (折り紙) comes from the Japanese _oru_ (to fold) and _kami_
(paper). The goal is to make objects out of one or more sheets of paper,
without any additional tools like glue or scissors. You can create incredibly
beautiful and impressive designs – all of these figures were built using nothing
but rectangular sheets of paper:

the folds you made before will be inverted. Then turn over and repeat.

{.step(data-t=135)} Make sure the two “legs” are pointing down. Then take the

repeat.

{.step(data-t=172)} You’re almost done! Slightly open the right side, and fold
the head up towards the top. You will have to turn it inside out. Then repeat
the same with the tail on the left.

{.step(data-t=203)} Reverse the fold as shown to create a beak. You can decide
how long you want it to be by picking the location of the fold.

{.step(data-t=215)} Finally, fold down the two wings, and pull them apart.

1992, by the Italian-Japanese mathematician Humiaki Huzita.

It turns out that these axioms are even more powerful than the Euclidean ones.
It is possible to trisect angles and double cubes using just paper folding!
Of course, it is impossible to fold any _curved_ lines, and you still can’t
square the circle with origami.

### Applications of Origami

Origami is an ancient art, and for the longest time, it was mostly a recreational
pursuit, without real-life applications. However, it turns out that techniques
developed for Origami can be incredibly useful in technology and engineering:

#### Origami in Space

Satellites need large solar panels to generate power. Unfortunately, the rockets
that carry satellites into space only have very limited space for cargo, and
any additional weight costs a lot of fuel.

Origami techniques allow solar panels to “unfold” when they reach space. Some
particularly clever folds are incredibly compact and require very few motors
and other mechanical components.

    // One of these is the __Miura Map Fold__, which was invented by _Korio Miura_.
    // The same is also true for the mirrors of telescopes in space. Larger mirrors
    // can take better images. Engineers can use Origami to build large mirrors that
    // can be folded up very efficiently when loaded onto rockets.

#### Origami in Medicine

In medicine, similar ideas from Origami are used on a much smaller scale. In
2003, researchers developed _Origami Stents_: tiny tubes that can be inserted
into blood vessels. They are initially folded up but can expand inside patients’
blood in order to enlarge clogged arteries or veins.

#### Foldable Bridges

The British and American military used Origami to develop foldable, mobile
bridges. These were important for quickly crossing rivers or anti-tank ditches,
and could be deployed much faster than previous designs.

They can also be used for disaster relief, to quickly give emergency vehicles
access after earthquakes or tsunamis. This image is of a prototype designed at
Hiroshima University in Japan.

#### Origami under the Sea

The depths of the oceans are some of the least explored areas on Earth. Animals
that live there are often squishy and delicate, which makes them very hard
to examine.

Here you can see a “trap” in the shape of a [dodecahedron](gloss:dodecahedron)
that can fold around marine organisms, allowing them to be studied. It is
remotely controlled and only needs a single motor to drive the complex folding
motion of its five arms.

that will compress rather than crumble during an earthquake, unfolding airbags
in cars, self-assembling robots, more efficient packaging, and lightweight
aircraft.

### Origami in Nature

It turns out that we humans are not the only ones harnessing the power of
Origami: nature has been doing so for millions of years.

Here you can see the wing of an __earwig__ that can be folded up using an
ingenious pattern. When opened, the size of the wing expands by a factor of 10 –
the highest “folding ratio” in the animal kingdom:

---
> id: origami-wings-1

When expanded, the large wings snap into a stable position that allows the
insects to fly. But it only takes the lightest touch for the wings to retract.
When folded up, they are compact enough to allow earwigs to tunnel underground.
Many other insects, bats, leaves and flowers use similar folding patterns to fit
large surfaces into small spaces.

Scientists are studying these plants and animals, hoping to mimic their abilities
in engineering and technology. Potential applications could include foldable
electronics in smartphones, expanding solar panels for satellites, or even
self-folding camping tents.

A similar principle is used by [DNA](gloss:dna), the molecules that carry the
genetic information in your body. 

Every human cell contains about 2 meters of DNA. If you could combine the
strands of DNA from all the cells in your body, their length would be more than
140 times the distance from Earth to the sun!

:::

Nature found a clever way to fit all that DNA into your body, without it getting
twisted or torn. Every strand of DNA is curled, folded, and held in place by
special molecules. This process, called _protein folding_ is one of the most
complex problems in biology. Understanding it better can help scientists develop
new drugs in the future.
