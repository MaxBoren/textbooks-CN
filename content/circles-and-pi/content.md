For as long as humans exist, we have looked to the sky and tried to explain life
on Earth using the motion of stars, planets and the moon.

Ancient Greek astronomers were the first to discover that all celestial objects
move on regular paths, called __orbits__. They believed that these orbits are
always circular. After all, circles are the “most perfect” of all shapes:
symmetric in every direction, and thus a fitting choice for the underlying
order of our universe.

Every point on a [__circle__](gloss:circle) has the same distance from its
center. This means that they can be drawn using a [compass](gloss:compass):

::: column(width=320)

    x-geopad(width=320 height=300 style="position: relative;")
      svg(style="stroke-linecap: round; stroke-linejoin: round")
        circle.move(name="a" cx=160 cy=150 target="r d")
        circle.move.reveal(name="b" cx=250 cy=240 project="circle(a, 120)" target="r" when="compass")

{.reveal(when="compass")} There are three important measurements related to
circles that you need to know:

* {.reveal(when="compass" delay="1000")} The [{.step-target.pill.b.red}radius](target:r)
  is the distance from the center of a circle to its outer rim.
* {.reveal(when="compass" delay="4000")} The [{.step-target.pill.b.blue}diameter](target:d)
  is the distance between two opposite points on a circle. It goes through its
  center, and its length is [[twice|half|the same as]] the radius.
* {.reveal(when="blank-0")} The [{.step-target.pill.b.green}circumference](target:c) 
  (or perimeter) is the distance around a circle.

> goals: circle-0 circle-1 circle-2

One important property of circles is that all circles are
[similar](gloss:similar). You can prove that by showing how all circles can
be matched up using simply [translations](gloss:translation) and
[dilations](gloss:dilation):

> goals: digits

You might remember that, for similar polygons, the ratio between corresponding
sides is always constant. Something similar works for circles: the ratio between
the [circumference](gloss:circle-circumference) and the
[diameter](gloss:circle-diameter) is equal for _all circles_. It is always
3.14159… – a mysterious number called [__Pi__](gloss:pi), which is often written
as the Greek letter _π_ for “p”. Pi has infinitely many decimal digits that go
on forever without any specific pattern:

    canvas.pi-spiral(width=800 height=760)

> id: wheel
> goals: unroll

Here is a wheel with diameter 1. As you “unroll” the circumference, you can see
that its length is exactly [[`pi`|`2 * pi`|3]]:

    x-gesture(target="#wheel .wheel" slide="100,0")

---
> id: circumference

For a circle with diameter _d_, the circumference is `C = π × d`. Similarly,
for a circle with [radius](gloss:circle-radius) _r_, the circumference is

{.text-center} `C =` [[`2 π r`|`π r`|`π r^2`]].

---
> id: nature

Circles are perfectly symmetric, and they don’t have any “weak points” like the
corners of a polygon. This is one of the reasons why they can be found
everywhere in nature:

::: column.grow

It also turns out that a circle is the shape with the largest area for a given
circumference. For example, if you have a rope of length 100\ m, you can use
it to enclose the largest space if you form a circle (rather than other shapes
like a rectangle or triangle).

In nature, objects like water drops or air bubbles can _save energy_ by becoming
circular or spherical, and reducing their surface area.

### The Area of a Circle

But how do we actually calculate the area of a circle? Let’s try the same
technique we used for [finding the area quadrilaterals](/course/polygons-and-polyhedra/quadrilaterals):
we cut the shape into multiple different parts, and then rearrange them into a
different shape we already know the area of (e.g. a rectangle or a triangle).

The only difference is that, because circles are curved, we have to use some
approximations:

::: column(width=340)

    svg.circle-area.red(width=340 height=245)
      defs
        marker#area-arrow(refX=4 refY=4 markerWidth=5 markerHeight=8 orient="auto-start-reverse")
          path(d="M 1 1 L 4 4 L 1 7" stroke-width=1)
      g.labels
        line.reveal(x1=62 y1=158 x2=62 y2=212 marker-start="url(#area-arrow)" marker-end="url(#area-arrow)" when="blank-1")
        line.reveal(x1=80 y1=226 x2=268 y2=226 marker-start="url(#area-arrow)" marker-end="url(#area-arrow)" when="blank-2")
        text.reveal(x=50 y=190 when="blank-1") r
        text.reveal(x=165 y=241 when="blank-2") πr
    x-slider(steps=400)

::: column.grow

Here you can see a circle divided into ${toWord(n1)} wedges. Move the slider,
to line up the wedges in one row.

{.reveal(when="slider")} If we increase the number of wedges to ${n1}{n1|6|6,30,2},
this shape starts to look more and more like a [[rectangle|circle|square]].

{.reveal(when="blank-0")} The height of the rectangle is equal to the
[[radius|circumference|diameter]] of the circle.
_{span.reveal(when="blank-1")} The width of the rectangle is equal to
[[half the circumference|the circumference|twice the radius]] of the circle._
_{span.reveal(when="blank-2")} (Notice how half of the wedges face down and
half of them face up.)_

{.reveal(when="blank-2" delay=1000)} Therefore the total area of the rectangle
is approximately `A = π r^2`.

:::

> id: area-1

::: column(width=340)

    svg.circle-area.blue(width=340 height=245)
      g.labels
        line.reveal(x1=20 y1=156 x2=20 y2=206 marker-start="url(#area-arrow)" marker-end="url(#area-arrow)" when="blank-1")
        line.reveal(x1=34 y1=218 x2=355 y2=218 marker-start="url(#area-arrow)" marker-end="url(#area-arrow)" when="blank-2")
        text.reveal(x=10 y=185 when="blank-1") r
        text.reveal(x=165 y=236 when="blank-2") 2πr
    x-slider(steps=400)

::: column.grow

Here you can see a circle divided into ${toWord(n)} rings. Like before, you can
move the slider to “uncurl” the rings.

{.reveal(when="slider")} If we increase the number of wedges to ${n2}{n2|4|2,12,1},
this shape starts to look more and more like a [[triangle|rectangle|trapezium]].

{.reveal(when="blank-0")} The height of the triangle is equal to the 
[[radius|diameter|circumference]] of the circle.
_{span.reveal(when="blank-1")} The base of the triangle is equal to [[the
circumference|twice the diameter]] of the circle._
_{span.reveal(when="blank-2")} Therefore the total area of the triangle is
approximately_

{.text-center.reveal(when="blank-2")} `A = 1/2 "base" × "height" = π r^2`.

:::

> id: area-2

If we could use infinitely many rings or wedges, the approximations above would
be perfect – and they both give us the same formula for the area of a circle:

{.text-center.r} `A = π r^2`.

### Calculating Pi

As you saw above, `π = 3.1415926…` is not a simple integer, and its decimal
digits go on forever, without any repeating pattern. Numbers with this property
are called [__irrational numbers__](gloss:irrational-numbers), and it means that
`π` cannot be expressed as a simple fraction `a/b`.

It also means that we can never write down _all_ the digits of Pi – after all,
there are infinitely many. Ancient Greek and Chinese mathematicians calculated
the first four decimal digits of Pi by approximating circles using regular
polygons. Notice how, as you add more sides, the polygon starts to look
[[more and more|less|exactly]] like a circle:

    figure: x-media(src="images/polygons.svg" width=460 height=110)

> id: pi-record

::: column(width=280)

    x-media(src="images/iss.jpg" width=280 height=330 credit="NASA")

::: column.grow

In 1665, [Isaac Newton](bio:newton) managed to calculate 15 digits. Today, we
can use powerful computers to calculate the value of Pi to much higher
accuracy.

The current record is 31.4 trillion digits. A printed book containing all these
digits would be approximately 400\ km thick – that’s the height at which the
[International Space Station](gloss:iss) orbits Earth!

Of course, you don’t need to remember that many digits of Pi. In fact, the
fraction `22/7 = 3.142…` is a great approximation.

:::

---
> id: pi-sequence

One approach for calculating Pi is using infinite sequences of numbers. Here is
one example which was discovered by [Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz](bio:leibniz) in
1676:

    p.text-center: span.math
      mi π
      mo(value="=") =
      mfrac #[mn 4]#[mn 1]
      mo –
      mfrac #[mn 4]#[mn 3]
      mo +
      mfrac #[mn 4]#[mn 5]
      mo –
      mfrac #[mn 4]#[mn 7]
      mo +
      mfrac #[mn 4]#[mn 9]
      mo –
      mfrac
        mn 4
        mrow.md [[11]]
      mo +
      mo …

{.reveal(when="blank-0")} As we calculate more and more terms of this series,
always following the same pattern, the result will get closer and closer to Pi.

Many mathematicians believe that Pi has an even more curious property: that it
is a __normal number__. This means that the digits from 0 to 9 appear completely
at random, as if nature had rolled a 10-sided dice infinitely many times, to
determine the value of Pi.

Here you can see the first 100 digits of Pi. Move over some of the cells, to see
how the digits are distributed.

          .pi-cell= d
      .pi-right: .pi-operator …

> id: pi-digits
> goals: search

If Pi is normal, it means that you can think of _any_ string of digits, and it
will appear somewhere in its digits. Here you can search the first one
million digits of Pi – do they contain your birthday?

    .box
      .box-title: h3 One Million Digits of Pi

        .pi-warning
      x-pi-scroll.box-body
        .first-row 3.

---
> id: pi-movies

We could even convert an entire book, like Harry Potter, into a very long string
of digits (a = 01, b = 02, and so on). If Pi is normal, this string will appear
somewhere in its digits – but it would take millions of years to calculate
enough digits to find it.

Pi is easy to understand, but of fundamental importance in science and
mathematics. That might be a reason why Pi has become unusually popular in our
culture (at least, compared to other topics of mathematics):

So far in geometry, we've always measured angles in [degrees](gloss:degrees). A
__{.m-red}full circle__ rotation is [[360]]°, a __{.m-green}half circle__ is
[[180]]°, a __{.m-yellow}quarter circle__ is [[90]]°, and so on.

numbers: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, and so on. This means that many
fractions of one circle are also whole numbers. But have you ever wondered
where the number 360 comes from? [Continue](btn:next)

> id: babylon

::: column.grow

As it happens, 360 degrees are one of the oldest concepts in mathematics we
still use today. They were developed in ancient Babylon, more than 5000 years
ago!

At that time, one of the most important applications of mathematics was in
astronomy. The _sun_ determines the four seasons, which farmers have to know
about when growing crops. Similarly, the _moon_ determines the tides, which
was important for fishers. People also studied the stars to predict the
future, or to communicate with gods.

Astronomers noticed that the constellations visible at a specific time during
the night shifted a tiny bit every day – until, after approximately 360 days,
they had rotated back to their starting point. And this might have been the
reason why they divided the circle into 360 degrees.

---
> id: constellations-1
> goals: video

Of course, there are actually 365 days in one year (well, 365.242199 to be
exact), but Babylonian mathematicians worked with simple sundials, and this
approximation was perfectly adequate.

It also worked well with their existing base-60 number system (since
`6 xx 60 = 360`). This system is the reason why we still have 60 seconds in a
minute and 60 minutes in an hour – even though most other units are measured
in [base 10](gloss:base-10) (e.g. 10 years in a decade, or 100 years in a century).

::: column.grow

For many of us, measuring angles in degrees is second nature: there is 360°
video, skateboarders can pull 540s, and someone changing their decision might
make a 180° turn.

But from a mathematical point of view, the choice of 360 is completely
arbitrary. If we were living on Mars, a circle might have 670°, and a year on
Jupiter even has 10,475 days.

### Radians

Rather than dividing a circle into some number of segments (like 360 degrees),
mathematicians often prefer to measure angles using the [circumference](gloss:circle-circumference)
of a [__unit circle__](gloss:unit-circle) (a circle with radius 1).

::: column(width=280)

two is very easy – just like you can convert between other units like meters and

### Distance Travelled

You can think of radians as the “distance traveled” along the circumference of
a unit circle. This is particularly useful when working with objects that are
moving on a circular path.

::: column.grow

For example, the [International Space Station](gloss:iss) orbits Earth once
every 1.5\ hours. This means its __speed of rotation__ is [[`(2 pi)/1.5`|
`1.5/(2 pi)`|`1.5 * pi`]] radians per hour.

{.reveal(when="blank-0")} In a [unit circle](gloss:unit-circle), the speed of
rotation is the same as the _actual_ speed, because the length of the
circumference is the same as one full rotation in radians (both are `2pi`).

{.reveal(when="blank-0" delay=1000)} The radius of the ISS orbit is 6800\ km,
which means that the _actual_ speed of the ISS has to be [[`(2 pi)/1.5 xx 6800`|
`(2 pi)/1.5 ÷ 6800`|`6800/(2 * pi)`]] _{span.reveal(when="blank-1")}= 28483 km
per hour._

> id: radians-distance-1

Can you see that, in this example, radians are a much more convenient unit than
degrees? Once we know the speed of rotation, we simply have to multiply by the
radius to get the actual speed.

Here is another example: your car has wheels with radius 0.25\ m. If you’re
driving at a speed of 20\ m/s, the wheels of your car rotate at [[`20/0.25 =
80`|`20 xx 0.25 = 5`|`0.25/50 = 0.0125`]] radians per second
_{span.reveal(when="blank-0")}(or `80/(2pi) = 13` rotations per second)._

### Trigonometry

For most simple geometry problems, degrees and radians are completely
interchangeable – you can either pick which one you prefer, or a question
might tell you which unit to give your answer in. However, once you study
more advanced [trigonometry](gloss:trigonometry) or [calculus](gloss:calculus),
it turns out that radians are much more convenient than degrees.

::: column.grow

Most calculators have a [special button](->.button.mode) to switch between
degrees and radians. Trigonometric functions like [__sin__](gloss:sin),
[__cos__](gloss:cos) and __tan__ take angles as input, and their inverse
functions __arcsin__, __arccos__ and __arctan__ return angles as output. The
current calculator setting determines which units are used for these angles.

Try using this calculator to calculate that

{.text-center} sin(30°) = [[0.5]] _{span.eqn-gap}_ cos(1°) = [[0.999]]<br>
sin(30 rad) = [[-0.988]] _{span.eqn-gap}_ cos(1 rad) = [[0.54]]

> id: small-angle

Using radians has one particularly interesting advantage when using the [__Sine
function__](gloss:sin). If `θ` is a very small angle (less than 20° or 0.3 rad),
then `"sin"(θ) ≈ θ`. For example,

{.text-center} sin(${x}{x|0.1|0,0.5,0.05}) `≈` ${sin(x)}…

{.reveal(when="var-0")} This is called the __small angle approximation__, and it
can greatly simplify certain equations containing trigonometric functions.
You’ll learn much more about this in the future.

### Chords

    // A chord is a line segment whose endpoints are on a circle. A diameter is the

    // Chord Theorem #1: In the same circle or congruent circles, minor arcs are
    // congruent if and only if their corresponding chords are congruent.
    // 
    // Notice the “if and only if” in the middle of the theorem. This means that Chord
    // Theorem #1 is a biconditional statement. Taking this theorem one step further,

    // 3. Erase the arc marks and lines beyond the points of intersection, leaving FE
    //    and E. Find the measure of these segments. What do you notice? 
    // 
    // Chord Theorem #4: In the same circle or congruent circles, two chords are
    // congruent if and only if they are equidistant from the center.
    // 
    // Recall that two lines are equidistant from the same point if and only if the
    // shortest distance from the point to the line is congruent. The shortest distance
    // from any point to a line is the perpendicular line between them. In this
    // theorem, the fact that FE=EG means that AB and CD are equidistant to the center
    // and AB≅CD.

    // Concentric Circles: Two or more circles that have the same center, but different radii.
    // Congruent Circles: Two or more circles with the same radius, but different centers.

### Arcs and Sectors

::: column.grow

Most scientists in ancient Greece agreed that the Earth is a sphere. There was
plenty of evidence: from ships disappearing behind the horizon at sea, to the
circular motion of stars during the night.

Unfortunately, no one knew exactly _how big_ Earth was – until around 200 BC,
when the mathematician [Eratosthenes](bio:eratosthenes) found an ingenious way
to measure Earth’s radius, using basic geometry. All we need is a bit more
knowledge about arcs and sectors of a circle.

As you can see in the diagram, an [{.red} arc](pill:arc) is a part of the
[[circumference|diameter|tangent]] of a circle, and a [{.yellow} sector](pill:sector)
is a part of the [[interior|radius|perimeter]] of a circle.

::: .reveal(when="blank-0 blank-1")
The arc between two points _A_ and _B_ is often written as `§arc(AB)`. This
definition is slightly ambiguous: there is a [{.purple} second arc](pill:major)
that connects _A_ and _B_ but goes the other way around the circle.

The smaller of the two arcs is called the __minor arc__, and the larger one is
called the __major arc__. If points _A_ and _B_ are exactly opposite each other,
both arcs have the same length and are [[semicircles|diameters|circumferences]].

> id: arcs-1

::: column.grow

To find the length of an arc or the area of a sector, we need to know about the
corresponding angle at the center of the circle: this is called the
[{.blue} central angle](pill:angle).

Notice how the arc, sector and angle all take up the _same proportion_ of a
full circle. For example, if the [{.blue} central angle](pill:angle) is
_{span.var-action}90°_, it takes up [[one quarter|one half|one third]] of a
[{.teal} full circle](pill:fangle).

::: .reveal(when="blank-0")
This means that the [{.red} length of the arc](pill:arc) is also `1/4` of the
[{.purple} whole circumference](pill:circ) of the circle, and the [{.yellow} area
of the sector](pill:sector) is `1/4` of the [{.orange} whole area](pill:area) of
the circle.

We can express this relationship in an equation:

{.text-center} `§ "arc length" / "circumference" = blank("sector area","circle radius","arc area") / "circle area" = "central angle" / blank("360°","180°","90°")`

Now we can rearrange these equations to find whichever variable we’re interested
in. For example,

::: column(width=320 parent="padded-thin")

| [{.red}arc length](pill) | = | `"circumference" × c/360` |
|                          | = | `2 π r × c/360`          |
{.eqn-system}

::: column(width=320)

| [{.yellow}sector area](pill) | = | `"circle area" × c/360` |
|                              | = | `π r^2 × c/360`         |
{.eqn-system}

:::

where _r_ is the radius of the circle, and _c_ is the size of the central
angle.

    // What the formulae are doing is taking the area of the whole circle, and
    // then taking a fraction of that depending on what fraction of the circle
    // the sector fills.

    // The length of an arc is the distance along the curved line of the
    // circumference of the circle. It is slightly longer than the straight
    // line connecting the same two points (the chord).

---
> id: arcs-rad

If the central angle is measured in [radians](gloss:radians) rather than
[degrees](gloss:degrees), we can use the same equations, but have to replace
360° with [[`2 π`|`1/2 π`|`π`]]:

::: .reveal(when="blank-0")
::: column(width=320 parent="padded-thin")

| [{.red}arc length](pill) | = | `2 π r × c/(2π)` |
|                          | = | `r × c`          |
{.eqn-system}

::: column(width=320)

| [{.yellow}sector area](pill) | = | `π r^2 × c/(2π)` |
|                              | = | `1/2 r^2 c`      |
{.eqn-system}

:::

Notice how the equations become much simpler, and _π_ cancels out everywhere.
This is because, as you might recall, the [definition of
radians](/course/circles-and-pi/radians#radians) is basically the length of an
arc in a circle with radius 1.

Now let’s see how we can use arcs and sectors to calculate the circumference of
the Earth. [Continue](btn:next)

In ancient Egypt, the city of _Swenet_ was located along the Nile river. Swenet was
famous for a well with a curious property: there was one moment every year when
the sunlight reached the very bottom of the well – at noon on 21 June, the day
of the _summer solstice_. At that precise time, the bottom of the well was
illuminated, but not its sides, meaning that the Sun was standing directly above
the well.

The mathematician [Eratosthenes](bio:eratosthenes) lived in _Alexandria_, about
800\ km North of Swenet, where he was director of the Great Library. In the city
centre of Alexandria stood an obelisk, a tall, narrow monument with a
pyramid-shaped top.

Eratosthenes noticed that at noon on the day of the summer solstice, the obelisk
was throwing a shadow – meaning that the sun was _not_ directly above it. He
deduced that this was because of the curvature of the Earth, and realised it
could be used to calculate our planet’s circumference.

Eratosthenes’ measurement was one of the most important experiments in
antiquity. His estimate of Earth’s size was surprisingly accurate, especially
when considering that he only had access to very basic measuring tools.

Of course, it can be difficult to translate his original results into modern
units like kilometres. In ancient Greece, distance was measured in _stadia_
(approximately 160 m), but there was no universal standard. Every area had a
slightly different version, and we don’t know which one Eratosthenes used.

In the following centuries, scientists tried to use other methods to calculate
the radius of Earth – sometimes with very different, and incorrect results.

It was one of these incorrect measurements that prompted Christopher Columbus to
sail west from Portugal. He assumed that Earth was much smaller than it actually
is, and hoped to reach India. In fact, he arrived at a different continent in
between: the Americas.

## The Circle Theorems

__[CC] Identify and describe relationships among inscribed angles, radii, and
chords. Include the relationship between central, inscribed, and circumscribed
angles; inscribed angles on a diameter are right angles; the radius of a circle
is perpendicular to the tangent where the radius intersects the circle.__

An inscribed angle is an angle with its vertex is the circle and its sides
contain chords. The intercepted arc is the arc that is on the interior of the
inscribed angle and whose endpoints are on the angle. The vertex of an inscribed
angle can be anywhere on the circle as long as its sides intersect the circle to
form an intercepted arc.

__Inscribed Angle Theorem__
The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
To prove the Inscribed Angle Theorem, you would need to split it up into three
cases, like the three different angles drawn from the Investigation.

__Congruent Inscribed Angle Theorem__
Inscribed angles that intercept the same arc are congruent.

__Inscribed Angle Semicircle Theorem__
An angle that intercepts a semicircle is a right angle.

In the Inscribed Angle Semicircle Theorem we could also say that the angle is
inscribed in a semicircle. Anytime a right angle is inscribed in a circle, the
endpoints of the angle are the endpoints of a diameter. Therefore, the converse
of the Inscribed Angle Semicircle Theorem is also true.

When an angle is on a circle, the vertex is on the circumference of the circle.
One type of angle on a circle is one formed by a tangent and a chord.

__Chord/Tangent Angle Theorem__
The measure of an angle formed by a chord and a tangent that intersect on the
circle is half the measure of the intercepted arc.

From the Chord/Tangent Angle Theorem, we now know that there are two types of
angles that are half the measure of the intercepted arc; an inscribed angle and
an angle formed by a chord and a tangent. Therefore, any angle with its vertex
on a circle will be half the measure of the intercepted arc.

An angle is considered inside a circle when the vertex is somewhere inside the
circle, but not on the center. All angles inside a circle are formed by two
intersecting chords.

__Intersecting Chords Angle Theorem__
The measure of the angle formed by two chords that intersect inside a circle is
the average of the measure of the intercepted arcs.

An angle is considered to be outside a circle if the vertex of the angle is
outside the circle and the sides are tangents or secants. There are three types
of angles that are outside a circle: an angle formed by two tangents, an angle
formed by a tangent and a secant, and an angle formed by two secants. Just like
an angle inside or on a circle, an angle outside a circle has a specific
formula, involving the intercepted arcs.

__Outside Angle Theorem__
The measure of an angle formed by two secants, two tangents, or a secant and a
tangent drawn from a point outside the circle is equal to half the difference
of the measures of the intercepted arcs.

When two chords intersect inside a circle, the two triangles they create are
similar, making the sides of each triangle in proportion with each other. If we
remove AD and BC the ratios between AE, EC, DE, and EB will still be the same.

__Intersecting Chords Theorem__
If two chords intersect inside a circle so that one is divided into segments of
length a and b and the other into segments of length c and d then ab=cd. In
other words, the product of the segments of one chord is equal to the product
of segments of the second chord.

In addition to forming an angle outside of a circle, the circle can divide the
secants into segments that are proportional with each other.

If we draw in the intersecting chords, we will have two similar triangles.

From the inscribed angles and the Reflexive Property (∠R≅∠R),△PRS∼△TRQ. Because
the two triangles are similar, we can set up a proportion between the
corresponding sides. Then, cross-multiply. ac+d=ca+b⇒a(a+b)=c(c+d)

__Two Secants Segments Theorem__
If two secants are drawn from a common point outside a circle and the segments
are labeled as above, then a(a+b)=c(c+d). In other words, the product of the
outer segment and the whole of one secant is equal to the product of the outer
segment and the whole of the other secant.

If a tangent and secant meet at a common point outside a circle, the segments
created have a similar relationship to that of two secant rays. Recall that the
product of the outer portion of a secant and the whole is equal to the same of
the other secant. If one of these segments is a tangent, it will still be the
product of the outer portion and the whole. However, for a tangent line, the
outer portion and the whole are equal.

__Tangent Secant Segment Theorem__
If a tangent and a secant are drawn from a common point outside the circle (and
the segments are labeled like the picture to the left), then a2=b(b+c). This
means that the product of the outside segment of the secant and the whole is
equal to the square of the tangent segment.

## Cyclic Polygons

> section: cyclic-polygons

__[CC] Construct an equilateral triangle, a square, and a regular hexagon
inscribed in a circle.__

An inscribed polygon is a polygon where every vertex is on a circle. Note, that
not every quadrilateral or polygon can be inscribed in a circle. Inscribed
quadrilaterals are also called cyclic quadrilaterals. For these types of
quadrilaterals, they must have one special property. We will investigate it here.

This investigation shows that the opposite angles in an inscribed quadrilateral
are supplementary. By cutting the quadrilateral in half, through the diagonal,
we were able to show that the other two angles (that we did not cut through)
formed a linear pair when matched up.

Inscribed Quadrilateral Theorem: A quadrilateral is inscribed in a circle if
and only if the opposite angles are supplementary.

## Spheres, Cones and Cylinders

> section: spheres-cones-cylinders
> id: solids

In the previous sections, we studied the properties of circles on a flat
surface. But our world is actually three-dimensional, so lets have a look at
some 3D solids that are based on circles:

::: column(width=220 parent="padded-thin")

    x-solid(size=220)

{.text-center} A [__cylinder__](gloss:cylinder) consists of two congruent,
parallel circles joined by a curved surface. 

::: column(width=220)

{.text-center} A [__cone__](gloss:cone) has a circular base that is joined to 
a single point (called the vertex).

::: column(width=220)

    x-solid(size=220 static)

{.text-center} Every point on the surface of a [__sphere__](gloss:sphere) has
the same distance from its center.

Notice how the definition of a sphere is almost the same as the definition of a
[[circle|radius|cube]] – except in three dimensions!

### Cylinders

::: column.grow

Here you can see the cylindrical _Gasometer_ in Oberhausen, Germany. It used to
store natural gas which was used as fuel in nearby factories and power plants.
The Gasometer is 120m tall, and its base and ceiling are two large circles with
radius 35m. There are two important questions that engineers might want to
answer:

* How much natural gas can be stored? This is the [[volume|area|diameter]] of
  the cylinder.
* {.reveal(when="blank-0")} How much steel is needed to build the Gasometer?
  This is (approximately) the [[surface area|circumference|diagonal]] of the
  cylinder.

{.reveal(when="blank-0 blank-1")} Let’s try to find formulas for both these
results!

> id: cylinder-prism

#### Volume of a Cylinder

The top and bottom of a cylinder are two congruent circles, called __bases__.
The __{.m-blue} height *h*__ of a cylinder is the perpendicular distance between
these bases, and the __{.m-red} radius *r*__ of a cylinder is simply the radius
of the circular bases.

We can approximate a cylinder using a ${n}{n|5|3,20,1}-sided
[__prism__](gloss:prism). As the number of sides increases, the prism starts to
look more and more like a cylinder:

::: column(width=240)

    x-solid(size=240)

::: column(width=240)

    x-solid(size=240)

:::

---
> id: cylinder-volume

Even though a cylinder is technically not a prism, they share many properties.
In both cases, we can find the volume by multiplying the area of their
__{.m-red} base__ with their __{.m-blue} height__. This means that a
cylinder with radius _{.b.m-red} r_ and height _{.b.m-blue} h_ has volume

{.text-center} `V =` _{x-equation(solution="π r^2 h" keys="+ − × ÷ π frac sup brackets" short-var hints="cylinder-volume-hint1 cylinder-volume-hint2")}_

{.reveal(when="eqn-0")} Remember that radius and height must use the same units.
For example, if _r_ and _h_ are both in cm, then the volume will be in
[[`"cm"^3`|`"cm"^2`|cm]].

---
> id: oblique-cylinder
> goals: slide

::: column.grow

In the examples above, the two bases of the cylinder were always _directly above
each other_: this is called a __right cylinder__. If the bases are not directly
above each other, we have an __oblique cylinder__. The bases are still parallel,
but the sides seem to “lean over” at an angle that is not 90°.

> id: cavalieri

The volume of an oblique cylinder turns out to be exactly the same as that of a
right cylinder with the same radius and height. This is due to [__Cavalieri’s
Principle__](gloss:cavalieri), named after the Italian mathematician
[Bonaventura Cavalieri](bio:cavalieri): if two solids have the same
cross-sectional area at every height, then they will have the same volume.

Imagine slicing a cylinder into lots of thin disks. We can then slide these
disks horizontal to get an oblique cylinder. The volume of the individual discs
does not change as you make it oblique, therefore the total volume also remains
constant:

#### Surface Area of a Cylinder

::: column.grow

To find the surface area of a cylinder, we have to “unroll” it into its flat
[net](gloss:net). You can try this yourself, for example by peeling off the
label on a can of food.

There are two [[circles|spheres|squares]], one at the top and one at the bottom
of the cylinder. The curved side is actually a large [[rectangle|square|ellipse]].

* {.reveal(when="blank-0 blank-1")} The two circles each have area
  _{x-equation.small(solution="π r^2" keys="+ × π sup" short-var)}_.
* {.reveal(when="eqn-0")} The height of the rectangle is

  _{span.reveal(when="eqn-1")}and the width of the rectangle is the

This means that the total surface area of a cylinder with radius _r_ and height
_h_ is given by

    figure: x-media(src="images/cylinders.jpg" width=460 height=125)

Cylinders can be found everywhere in our world – from soda cans to toilet paper
or water pipes. Can you think of any other examples?

The _Gasometer_ above had a radius of 35m and a height of 120m. We can now
calculate that its volume is approximately [[461,000 ± 1000]]`"m"^3` and its
surface area is approximately [[34,080 ± 100]]`"m"^2`.

> id: cone

### Cones

::: column.grow

A [__cone__](gloss:cone) is a 3-dimensional solid that has a circular
__{.m-red}base__. Its side “tapers upwards” as shown in the diagram, and ends
in a single point called the __{.m-green}vertex__.

The __{.m-red}radius__ of the cone is the radius of the circular base, and the
__{.m-blue}height__ of the cone is the perpendicular distance from the base
to the vertex.

Just like other shapes we met before, cones are everywhere around us: ice cream
cones, traffic cones, certain roofs, and even christmas trees. What else can you
think of?

#### Volume of a Cone

::: column.grow

We previously found the volume of a cylinder by approximating it using a prism.
Similarly, we can find the volume of a cone by approximating it using a
[__pyramid__](gloss:pyramid).

Here you can see a ${n}{n|5|3,18,1}-sided pyramid. As the number of sides
increases, the pyramid starts to look more and more like a cone. In fact, we
could think of a cone as a pyramid with _infinitely many_ sides!

::: column(width=280)

    x-solid(size=280 style="margin: -44px 0 -20px 0")

:::

---
> id: cone-volume-1

This also means that we can also use the equation for the volume:
`V = 1/3 "base" × "height"`. The base of a cone is a circle, so the volume of a
cone with radius _r_ and height _h_ is

{.text-center} `V =` _{x-equation(solution="1/3 π × r^2 h" keys="+ − × ÷ π frac sup brackets" short-var hints="cone-volume-hint1 cone-volume-hint2")}_

---
> id: cone-circumscribed

Notice the similarity with the equation for the volume of a cylinder. Imagine
drawing a cylinder _around_ the cone, with the same base and height – this is
called the __circumscribed cylinder__. Now, the cone will take up exactly [[one
third|half|one quarter]] of the volume of the cylinder:

    figure: x-solid(size=280)

---
> id: cone-hilbert

{.i.lgrey} Note: You might think that infinitely many tiny sides as an approximation
is a bit “imprecise”. Mathematics spent a long time trying to find a more
straightforward way to calculate the volume of a cone. In 1900, the great
mathematician [David Hilbert](bio:hilbert) even named it as one of the 23 most
important unsolved problems in mathematics! Today we know that it is actually
impossible.

---
> id: oblique-cone
> goals: slide

::: column.grow

Just like a cylinder, a cone doesn’t have to be “straight”. If the vertex is
directly over the center of the base, we have a __right cylinder__. Otherwise,
we call it an __oblique cylinder__.

Once again, we can use Cavalieri’s principle to show that all oblique cylinders
have the same volume, as long as they have the same base and height.

#### Surface Area of a Cone

::: column.grow

Finding the surface area of a cone is a bit more tricky. Like before, we can
unravel a cone into its net. Move the slider to see what happens: in this
case, we get one circle and one [[circle sector|circle segment|circle arc]].

{.reveal(when="blank-0")} Now we just have to add up the area of both these
components. The __{.m-yellow}base__ is a circle with radius _r_, so its area is

slant height *s*__ of the cone, and not the same as the normal
__{.pill.blue.step-target(data-to="h")}height *h*__. We can find the slant
height using [Pythagoras](gloss:pythagoras-theorem):

both a cone and a sphere perfectly in its inside:

::: column.r(width=220)

    x-solid(size=220 style="margin-top: -20px")
    .large-op.reveal(when="blank-0" animation="pop") +

{.text-center} This cone has radius `r` and height `2r`. Its volume is
_{x-equation.small(solution="2/3 π r^3" keys="× π sup frac" short-var)}_

::: column.r(width=220)

    x-solid(size=220 style="margin-top: -20px")

{.reveal(when="eqn-0 eqn-1 eqn-2")} Notice how, if we [[add

the volume of the cylinder!

#### Surface Area of a Sphere

Finding a formula for the surface area of a sphere is very difficult. One reason
is that we can’t open and “flatten” the surface of a sphere, like we did for
cones and cylinders before.

This is a particular issue when trying to create maps. Earth has a curved,
3-dimensional surface, but every printed map has to be flat and 2-dimensional.
This means that Geographers have to cheat: by stretching or squishing certain
areas.

Here you can see few different types of maps, called __projections__. Try moving
the red square, and watch what this area _actually_ looks like on a globe:

    .sphere-maps
      x-select.tabs
        .projection Mercator
        .projection Cylindrical
        .projection Robinson

        .left

            path.outline
            path.grid
            path.land
            path.map-select
        .right

            path.outline
            path.grid
            path.land
            rect.map-select(x="-24" y="-24" width=48 height=48 style="cursor: move")
          p.caption As you move the square on the map, notice how the size and shape of the #[em actual] area changes on the 3-dimensional globe.

To find the surface area of a sphere, we can once again approximate it using a
different shape – for example a polyhedron with lots of faces. As the number of
faces increases, the polyhedron starts to look more and more like a sphere.

{.todo} COMING SOON: Sphere Surface Area Proof

    // If we connect the small polygons to the center of the sphere, we get
    // lots of small pyramids pointing inwards. The diagram shows one of these pyramids
    // in red. The height of each pyramid is the [[radius|diameter]] of the sphere.
    
    // Here is a
    // volume = lots of cones = 1/3 * radius * lots of bases = 1/3 * radius * surface area
    
    // And therefore,
    // surface area = 3 * volume / radius = 
    
    // In other words, the surface area of a sphere with radius _r_ is `S = 4 π r^2`.

## Conic Sections

The circle is one of four different shapes which can be created using “slices”
through a [cone](gloss:cone). This can be demonstrated using the light cone of
a torch:

    x-conic-section
    x-scale-box(width=760).conics
      .row
        .active
          p: strong Circle
          include svg/circle.svg
        .hide
          p: strong Ellipse
          include svg/ellipse.svg
        .hide
          p: strong Parabola
          include svg/parabola.svg
        .hide
          p: strong Hyperbola
          include svg/hyperbola.svg

> id: conics-1

If you point the torch vertically downwards, you see a [[circle|ellipse|oval]]
of light. _{span.reveal(when="blank-0")}If you tilt the cone, you get an
[__ellipse__](gloss:ellipse). If you tilt it even further, you get a
[__parabola__](gloss:parabola) or a [__hyperbola__](gloss:hyperbola)._

Collectively, these four shapes are called [__conic sections__](gloss:conic-section).
Even though they all look very different, they are closely related: in fact,
they can all be generated using the same equation!

Conic sections were first studied by the ancient Greek mathematician [Apollonius
of Perga](bio:apollonius), who also gave them their unusual names.

In later courses, you’ll learn much more about parabolas and hyperbolas. For
now, let’s have a closer look at the ellipse.

### Ellipses

An ellipse just looks almost like an “elongated circle”. In fact, you could
think about it as a circle with _two centers_ – these are called __focal
points__. Just like every point on a circle has the same distance from its
center, every point on an ellipse has the same _sum of distances_ to its two
focal points.

If you have a long string connected to two fixed points, you can draw a perfect
ellipse by tracing the maximum reach of the strings:

{.todo} Coming soon: Ellipses drawing interactive

    // ---
    // > id: ellipses-1
    // You can also move the focal points around. Notice how, if they are further
    // apart, the ellipse will be [[more|less]] elongated. If they are close together,
    // it will look almost like a [[circle|parabola|trapezium]].

### Planetary Orbits

::: column.grow

You might remember from the very beginning of this course, that ancient Greek
astronomers believed that the Earth is at the centre of the universe and that
the sun, moon and planets move around Earth on circular orbits.

Unfortunately, astronomical observation of the sky didn’t quite support this.
For example, the sun appeared larger during some parts of the year and smaller
during others. On a circle, every point should have [[the same|an increasing|a
decreasing]] distance from its center.

To fix this, astronomers added __Epicycles__ to their model of the solar system:
planets move on a large circle around Earth, while simultaneously rotating on
a smaller circle. While very complicated, this was the most widely accepted
model of our universe for more than 1000 years:

Over time, people realised that Earth was just one of many planets orbiting the
sun (the __Heliocentric model__), but it wasn’t until 1609, that the astronomer
[Johannes Kepler](bio:kepler) discovered that planets actually move on
_elliptical orbits_.

The sun is in one of the two focal points of these ellipses. The planets speed
up as they get closer to the sun, and slow down as they move further away.

> id: newton
> goals: apple

A few decades later, [Isaac Newton](bio:newton) was able to prove Kepler’s
observations, using his newly developed laws of [__gravity__](gloss:gravity).
Newton realised that there is a force between any two masses in the universe –
similar to the attraction between two magnets. 

Gravity is what makes everything fall to the ground and gravity is also what
makes the planets move around the sun. It is only the great speed at which
planets move, that prevents them from falling directly into the sun.

Using Newton’s laws, you can derive the path that objects take when moving under
the force of gravity. It turns out that Planets move on ellipses, but other
objects like comets can travel on [parabolic](gloss:parabola) or
[hyperbolic](gloss:hyperbola) paths: they fly close to the sun before turning
around and shooting off into the universe, never to come back.

According to legend, a falling apple inspired Newton to think about gravity. He
was one of the most influential scientist of all time, and his ideas shaped our
understanding of the world for nearly 300 years – until Albert Einstein
discovered relativity in 1905.
