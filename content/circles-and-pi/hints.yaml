cylinder-volume-hint1: You have to find the area of the base, and then multiply it by _h_.
cylinder-volume-hint2: The base is a circle with radius _r_, so its area is `π r^2`.

cone-volume-hint1: You have to find the area of the base, and then multiply it by `1/3 h`.
cone-volume-hint2: The base is a circle with radius _r_, so its area is `π r^2`.

cone-surface-1: You have to substitute the correct value for each of the values above.
cone-surface-2: Remember to use the value for _s_ we found before.

circle-cross-sec: Use the equation for the area of a circle, and subtitute the correct value for `x^2`.
sphere-volume: Remember that the cylinder and cone above both had radius _r_ and height _r_.

use-cylinder-volume: Try using the formula for the volume of a cylinder.
use-cylinder-surface: Try using the formula for the surface area of a cylinder.
